# Portfolio Website (HTML&CSS)
Assessment for Coder Academy Bootcamp - HTML &amp; CSS Portfolio Website

For this assessment we were to create a Portfolio website incorporating a home page with contact information, professional history, an example blog with lorem ipsum text and an interests page. The project was to showcase the use of CSS and HTML, especially the use of media queries in CSS to allow for display on multiple device types (and page widths).
